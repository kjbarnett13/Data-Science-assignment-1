# Data-Science-assignment-1
For this drill, you'll work with data from the City of New York, which has provided statistics on baby names since 2011. You'll need to use the string functions that you learned about to tidy up the text fields in this workbook.

Requirements
Convert the values in the Gender, Ethnicity, and Child's First Name columns to proper case.
Create a column called Name beginning letter. Fill your new column with just the first letter of each first name.
There is some inconsistency in the Ethnicity column. In 2012, records are as follows: ASIAN AND PACI, BLACK NON HISP, and WHITE NON HISP. In other years, records feature ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER, BLACK NON HISPANIC, and WHITE NON HISPANIC. Use the SUBSTITUTE function to replace the first set of labels with the second set.
